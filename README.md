# POSIX Thread Scheduler using Round Robin 

This project implements a POSIX  uniprocessor thread scheduler using different synchronization techniques. It uses a Round Robin priority algorithm, using a dynamic library between threads that must be planned. While waiting for I/O events, threads receive an ID and the scheduler will receive a threshold as input parameter.
